# Service Prediction of Medical Facility

This project focuses on classifying patient data and uncovering patterns using machine learning techniques such as **Decision Trees** and **Clustering**. It utilizes a healthcare dataset (`quality.csv`) with various patient attributes to predict certain outcomes and visualize important decision-making features.

## üß† Project Highlights

- **Classification using Decision Trees** (Scikit-learn)
- **Clustering using KMeans & DBSCAN**
- **Correlation Analysis with Heatmap**
- **Feature Importance Visualization**
- Clean visualizations for model interpretability
